## Limited Capacity Problem

### Paper
Each paper added to the repository will be analyzed and summarized to make the search process easier:
  * **BikeAvail_ML**: Using RF, LSBoost and PLSR to model bike available at each station. Use also neighbors stations to make prediction.
  * **DemandPrediction_BS**: Hierarchical traffic prediction model to predict check-out/in number of each station cluster. Add station clustering with iterative spectral clustering algorithms. Use GBRT to predict total check-out/in.
  * **BikeNumber**: Mathematical analysis (using BGIP) to predict number of bikes at each station.
  * **BikeForecasting_for_Rebalancing**: Full-stack system to optimize daily rebalancing operations, of BS systems, using MLP and RF algorithms.
  * **PredictingOccupancyTrends**: Saturation predicitons of BS of Barcellona, prediction, up to 2 days, of full or empty station.
  * **BalanceBS_System**: Analyze user behaviour in BSS to improve the quality of it, both in case of incentive or not. Use clustering on bike rides.
  * **OptimizationFieldOp_BS**: Full-stack system to optimized BSS management. Prediction studied with MLP algorithm.
  * **PredictOneDayAhead**: Analysis at City level of granularity, different algorithm and considerations about over-fitting problems
  * **CloseLoop_PredictionBS**: Use probabilistic station-station approach. Based on large Hangzhou dataset, manage also unpredicted events. Evaluate a lot of prediction algorithm like baseline: HM, ARMA, RF, PFM, PD.
