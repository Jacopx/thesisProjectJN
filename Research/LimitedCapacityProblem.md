## Limited Capacity Problem

Each paper added to the repository will be analyzed and summarized to make the search process easier:
  * **BikeAvail_ML**: Using RF, LSBoost and PLSR to model bike available at each station. Use also neighbors stations to make prediction.
  * **DemandPrediction_BS**: Hierarchical traffic prediction model to predict check-out/in number of each station cluster. Add station clustering with iterative spectral clustering algorithms. Use GBRT to predict total check-out/in.
  * **BikeNumber**: Mathematical analysis (using BGIP) to predict number of bikes at each station.
  * **BikeForecasting_for_Rebalancing**: Full-stack system to optimize daily rebalancing operations, of BS systems, using MLP and RF algorithms.
  * **PredictingOccupancyTrends**: Saturation predicitons of BS of Barcellona, prediction, up to 2 days, of full or empty station.
  * **BalanceBS_System**: Analyze user behaviour in BSS to improve the quality of it, both in case of incentive or not. Use clustering on bike rides.
