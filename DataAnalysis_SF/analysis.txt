BikeSharing SF Data Analysis
------------------
The data getted from: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share
The data structure is composed of:
  * station.csv - Contains data that represents a station where users can pickup or return bikes.
  * status.csv - data about the number of bikes and docks available for given station and minute.
  * trips.csv - Data about individual bike trips
  * weather.csv - Data about the weather on a specific day for certain zip codes


To forecast
------------
Prediction of bike availability respect different time and different station of the day.


Analysis
---------
All the previuos research about this, or similar, dataset show a lot of different correlation. One of the most important is the type of client (customer or subscriber) and the time, or the day of the week, of the utilization. There are also, in case of SF, lot of correlation with the weather.
Searching through previous experience seems that Random Forest should be a good algorithm for this analysis. Other research have used also MLE and MAP models.
